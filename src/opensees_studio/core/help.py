"""Contextual help: what every command is for, what its parameters mean, and
the mechanics behind the analysis it starts.

F1 anywhere opens the help at whatever the user is looking at. The content lives
here, in one place, grouped the way the menu bar is; the window that shows it is
:mod:`opensees_studio.views.help_window`, and the mapping from a menu action to
its topic is :data:`ACTION_TOPICS` (keyed by the action's attribute name on the
main window, so a new action without help fails a test rather than opening
nothing).

Writing help is prose, so the bodies are written in a tiny markup instead of
HTML: paragraphs separated by blank lines, ``-`` for bullets, ``#`` for a
heading, and ``**bold**``. :func:`body_to_html` turns that into what
``QTextBrowser`` renders, which keeps this file readable and reviewable.

# The workflow
1. **Define** the model: grids and nodes, then members (draw tools, the portal
frame wizard, or File → Import for a DXF drawing), then materials and sections.
2. **Assign** the properties: restraints and masses on joints, sections,
materials, geometric transformations and beam integration rules on frame
elements, loads in a load pattern.
3. **Analyze**: Analyze → Check Model Stability finds mechanisms before
anything is solved; then create one or more cases (Analyze → Cases) and run them
(Analyze → Run). The solve happens in a separate process, so a crash in the
solver cannot take the interface with it.
4. **Display** the results: deformed shape, mode shapes, force diagrams, time
histories, hysteresis, pushover curves and response spectra.

# Axes
**Z is the elevation axis of every model.** A 3D model uses X, Y and Z; a 2D
model lives in the **X-Z plane** (every node at y = 0, Z up), so its joints move
in Ux and Uz and turn in Ry, and gravity acts along -Z in both. OpenSees itself
solves a 2D model in its own x-y plane; the application translates on the way
in and out, so you never see that plane. A 2D project saved by an earlier build
(X-Y plane, Y up) is turned into the X-Z plane when it is opened, loads and
supports included, and is saved that way.

# Where things are
- The **3D viewport** is the model; clicking selects, dragging orbits.
- Everything is a command on an undo stack: Ctrl+Z undoes one model edit.
- The **Properties** panel follows the selection; with several joints or elements
  selected it edits what they share in one step.
- Every dialog that takes numbers has a help page: **press F1** while the menu
or the dialog is open.
- The **Console** dock keeps a log of what the application did, including the
commands it emitted to OpenSees.

# What is not here
Nothing is unit-aware behind your back: see **Units and the solver**. Nothing is
solved until you ask: editing the model never starts an analysis.

# Finding your way
- **Where is each command?** — the menu map lists every menu entry with one line.
- **I know the OpenSees command, where is it?** — the annex lists every command of
the OpenSeesPy manual and where it lives (a form, automatic, or a custom block).

Every number you type is in **your** unit system, consistently: if lengths are
metres, forces are newtons and stresses pascals; if lengths are millimetres,
forces are newtons and stresses megapascals. The solver adds and multiplies
numbers and never checks them, so the only thing that matters is that one system
is used throughout.

- The project records two things: the **model units** its values are typed in,
  and the **display units** results are shown in (Options → Set Display Units).
  Changing the display units converts the numbers on diagrams, tables and plots
  — it never rewrites the model, and never re-interprets what you typed.
- **g** is 9.80665 m/s² in SI, 9806.65 mm/s² in millimetres, 32.174 ft/s² in US
  customary — the app picks the one matching your system when a dialog needs it.
- When a value is converted (an imperial shape into an SI project, for instance)
  the dialog shows both the published and the converted value, and says so.

The classic mistake is mixing them: a mass in kg with a stiffness in N/mm gives
a period that is wrong by a factor of 1000. There is no unit checking to catch
it — only a sanity check on the period, which the modal case reports.

A static case solves the equilibrium of the model under the loads of its
patterns. In one step, with a linear model, that is a single solve; in several
steps it is a load ramp, which is what a non-linear model needs.

# Parameters
- **Number of steps** — how many increments the pattern's total load is divided
  into. One step is right for a linear model; a model with material or geometric
  non-linearity needs enough steps for the solver to follow the path (10 to 100
  is typical).
- **Patterns** — which load patterns take part. Several patterns are applied
  together, which is how a gravity preload plus a lateral load is built.
- **Numberer / system** — how the equations are ordered and solved. The default
  is fine; a sparse direct system with an RCM or AMD numberer is faster on large
  models.
- **Tolerances and algorithm** — only used by the non-linear algorithms
  (Newton, ModifiedNewton, KrylovNewton) and the convergence test.

# Mechanics
The solver assembles the stiffness matrix **K** and the load vector **F** and
solves for the displacements **u**. Element forces follow from the displacements,
not from the loads directly — which is why a redundant structure redistributes
its internal forces as members yield.

A gravity preload followed by `loadConst -time 0.0` (the *chained* workflow) keeps
the gravity state and starts the next pattern from a zero time, so the following
transient or pushover does not re-apply gravity.

A modal case solves the generalised eigenvalue problem **K φ = ω² M φ**. What
comes out is, per mode, an eigenvalue ω² (and its period T = 2π/ω), a mode shape
and a participation factor.

# Parameters
- **Number of modes** — how many. One rule of thumb is enough modes to cover
  90 % of the mass in each direction; the results panel reports the
  participation, so it is visible rather than assumed.
- **Mass** — comes from the nodal masses (Assign → Joint → Masses) and from any
  element mass (a section's density, `rho`). A model with no mass has no modes.

# Mechanics
- The **period** is what a response spectrum needs: the pseudo-acceleration
  Sa(T) read at the mode's period is what scales the mode.
- Mode shapes are normalised to unit modal mass and their sign is arbitrary;
  the application normalises it deterministically (largest component positive)
  so two runs of the same model look the same.
- A **repeated eigenvalue** (a symmetric structure has pairs) returns any two
  orthogonal shapes of that subspace; because "any" depends on the starting
  vector, the application orthogonalises them before display or combination.
- The solver is chosen rather than guessed: a dense solver for small models
  (exact, no start vector, deterministic), ARPACK above a size threshold
  (faster). ARPACK keeps its random start vector, so only its first call in a
  process is reproducible — the application re-runs such a case in a fresh child
  process instead of risking a different answer.

A pushover case applies the pattern's load while increasing a **control
displacement** at a chosen node and DOF, recording the base shear at every step.
It is monotonic: the point is the sequence in which members yield and where the
capacity curve softens, not the cycling.

# Parameters
- **Control node and DOF** — where the displacement is imposed, usually the roof
  in the lateral direction (in 3D: DOF 1 for X, 2 for Y, 3 for Z, 4-6 for
  rotations; in a 2D model: 1 for X, 2 for Z, 3 for the rotation Ry). A positive
  target on a 2D rotation turns about +Y, the global convention.
- **Target displacement** — how far the node is pushed. It comes from a design
  displacement, a code formula, or a fraction of the height.
- **Steps and increment** — the target divided into steps. Too few and the
  solver can jump past a limit point.
- **Algorithm and convergence test** — Newton-family iterations with a
  displacement or energy test; a pushover that fails to converge is reporting a
  real limit, not necessarily a bug.

# Mechanics
The base shear vs roof displacement curve is the structure's capacity. On it:
- the **initial slope** is the elastic stiffness;
- **yielding** of the first member shows as a kink;
- a **softening** branch means a mechanism is forming;
- the **overstrength** is how much more the structure carries than its first
  yield, and the **ductility** is the displacement at the target over the yield
  displacement. Both are read off the curve by hand or by a bilinear fit.

A transient case integrates the equations of motion in time. The input is a
ground motion (or a time series), and the output is a history of any response
you asked the recorder for.

# Parameters
- **Time step (dt)** — must be small enough to follow the input and the modes
  that matter: a rule of thumb is dt ≤ T_min/10 for the highest mode carrying
  mass. The application checks the record's own step and says if they differ.
- **Number of steps** — usually the record length divided by dt.
- **Rayleigh damping** — C = α·M + β·K, given as a damping ratio ζ at two
  periods (or as α and β directly). For one target ratio at one period, β =
  2ζ/ω. The two periods must bracket the range that matters; damping applied to
  a range it was not fitted to is a common source of surprises.
- **Modal damping** — one ratio ζ for each of the first N modes (OpenSees
  `modalDamping`), as SAP2000 and ETABS damp a modal history: every mode up to N
  gets exactly ζ, whatever its period, so no pair of periods has to be chosen.
  The runner computes the N modes after the preload (dense solver at or below
  500 free DOF, ARPACK above) and adds the modal damping to any Rayleigh damping;
  N is capped at the number of free DOF. Modes above N get no modal damping.
  Checked against the logarithmic decrement of a damped single-DOF free
  vibration.
- **Algorithm** — Newmark (average acceleration is the default and is
  unconditionally stable for linear models) or HHT with its α parameter.
- **Integrator and convergence** — for a non-linear model, the same Newton
  family and tolerance settings as a static case, per step.

# Mechanics
- Mass-proportional damping (α) damps the low modes; stiffness-proportional
  (β) damps the high ones. Fitting ζ at two periods sets both.
- **Stiffness-proportional damping with `-doRayleigh`** on the elements makes
  the damping forces depend on the element's own velocity, which is what makes
  an imposed support motion propagate correctly.
- A run that stops early did not converge; the log records the step it reached
  and the results keep what was computed. That is a result, not a crash: a
  non-converged step usually means the model is too coarse, the step is too
  large, or the structure has become unstable.

Three kinds of spectrum meet in this application, and they are not the same
object:

- a **target spectrum** (Ground Motions → Target spectrum) is a *design*
  spectrum in g: the dialog plots it and the record-scaling reads it;
- a **case response spectrum** (``project.spectra``) is the tabulated curve a
  response-spectrum *analysis* reads, with Sa in the project's acceleration unit;
- a **record spectrum** is computed from one ground motion, to compare with the
  design curve.

# Defining one
- **User table** — a period/Sa file (period in s, Sa in g). It is copied point for
  point into the case spectrum: resampling a table somebody typed would change
  the numbers they meant.
- **ASCE 7-16** — from the mapped MCER ``Ss`` and ``S1`` and the site class, or
  from ``SDS`` and ``SD1`` directly, with ``TL`` from the maps (4 s to 16 s).
  The site coefficients come from Tables 11.4-1 and 11.4-2 and the design values
  from Eqs. (11.4-1) to (11.4-4): ``SDS = 2/3 Fa Ss``, ``SD1 = 2/3 Fv S1``.
  - **Site class F is a site-specific study** (§11.4.8), and so is class E beyond
    ``Ss = 0.75`` or ``S1 = 0.1``: the dialog says so and refuses to extrapolate
    a table the standard leaves blank. Use your own site spectrum instead.
  - Where class **D is assumed** because the soil is unknown, §11.4.3 forbids
    ``Fa`` below 1.2; the checkbox applies that floor.
- **TBDY 2018** — the same machinery with the Turkish site coefficients, ``TL``
  fixed at 6 s.

# Using one
"Use as case spectrum" turns the spectrum on screen into the tabulated curve a
case reads, sampling the code's own corner periods (T0, Ts, TL) so the plateau
and both decay branches survive, and converting g into the project's acceleration
unit. A response-spectrum *case* then points at it by id (Analyze → Cases), and
the modal combination (SRSS or CQC) does the rest.

A response spectrum case takes a design spectrum (a code spectrum such as
TBDY-2018, a user target spectrum, or one computed from a record) and the
structure's modes, and combines them into a design response.

# Parameters
- **Spectrum and direction** — the curve, its damping and the direction it acts
  in (horizontal X/Y, vertical Z). The application's default damping is 5 %.
- **Combination rule** — **SRSS** (root sum of squares) or **CQC** (complete
  quadratic combination). SRSS assumes the modes are far apart in period; CQC
  adds the cross terms with a correlation coefficient and is the safer default
  when modes are close, which is the usual case for a 3D building.
- **Scale** — the spectrum can be scaled, and a target-spectrum case reports the
  scale factors it needs per period range.
- **Modes** — every mode used must be orthogonalised and sign-normalised; the
  application does that before combining, so a repeated eigenvalue cannot
  produce a wrong combination.

# Mechanics
The peak response of mode *i* is Sa(T_i)·Γ_i·φ_i (Γ is the modal participation
factor). The total peak is **not** the sum: the modes do not peak at the same
instant, so they are combined statistically. SRSS/CQC give a design envelope,
not a time history — nothing here tells you when the peak happens.

**Forces and reactions.** Element forces, support reactions and shell
resultants come from the static response of the model to each mode's equivalent
load, M·φ_i·Γ_i·Sa(T_i), combined component by component with the same rule and
correlation as the displacements. They are peak magnitudes (the sign is lost in
the combination), and a combination uses them as plus and minus that peak. The
load uses the nodal mass, as the participation factors do; mass given as an
element density is not in it.

For a nonlinear structure a response spectrum is only an approximation: it comes
from linear modal analysis. The usual route is a pushover or a transient.

        """
Ground-motion records live in the project catalog (Define → Ground Motions).
Each entry has a file, a format, a unit and metadata computed from the samples.

# Parameters
- **Format** — PEER `.AT2`, two-column (time, acceleration) or single-column
  (acceleration only, with a step you provide).
- **Acceleration unit** — `g` or the project's acceleration unit; the factor is
  stored with the record so what the solver receives is explicit.
- **Scaling** — by PGA, by Sa(T1) of a chosen period, or to match a target
  spectrum over a period range. Every scaling factor is recorded in the case and
  reported, so a scaled run can be explained later.
- **Metadata** — PGA, PGV, PGD, Arias intensity and the 5-95 % significant
  duration, all computed from the samples and stored with the record.

# Mechanics
- A **uniform excitation** applies the record at every support, which is the
  usual assumption for a small structure; a **multiple-support** (imposed
  displacement) case drives chosen supports with different records, which is
  what a long bridge needs.
- The record's own time step and the analysis step must agree, or the
  application resamples and says so. Reading a 0.005 s record into a 0.01 s
  analysis silently halves the frequency content.
- Scaling by Sa(T1) is not the same as scaling by PGA: the first matches the
  demand at the structure's own period, the second matches the amplitude of the
  input.

        """
An elastomeric or sliding bearing is modelled as a **zero-length element between
two coincident nodes**: the nodes sit at the same point, and the element's
deformation is the relative displacement between them.

# Parameters (elastomeric, plasticity or Bouc-Wen)
- **Kinit** — the initial (unloaded) shear stiffness. It sets the period at
  small amplitude.
- **Qd** — the characteristic strength: the height of the hysteresis loop's
  flat part. Divided by the weight it gives the isolator's `Qd/W`.
- **α1 / α2** — the post-yield stiffness ratio before and after the second
  branch; α2 < α1 is what produces the stiffening at large displacement.
- **μ, η, β, γ** — the Bouc-Wen parameters: the hysteresis shape. β and γ
  together set whether the loop is softening, hardening or bilinear.

# Parameters (friction pendulum, flat slider)
- **μ** — the friction coefficient. The force is μ·N, so the friction model
  matters: a constant Coulomb μ, a velocity-dependent μ(v), or a μ that depends
  on the normal force.
- **R_eff** — the pendulum radius: the restoring stiffness is W/R_eff and the
  isolated period is T = 2π·√(R_eff/g).

# Mechanics
A bilinear isolator's loop encloses an area 4·Qd·(D - Dy) per cycle: that area
is the energy the bearing dissipates, and it is the reason to use one. The
**effective damping** follows from that area; the **effective stiffness** from
the secant between the loop's extremes.
- The two nodes must be **coincident**; the duplicate checker leaves them alone
  on purpose (see Edit → Check Model for Duplicates).
- A bearing is not a support: if both nodes are free to translate the isolator
  does nothing. One of them is normally restrained.

        """
A `ShellMITC4` is a four-node shell: it carries in-plane membrane forces and
out-of-plane bending at once. Walls, slabs and shear walls are modelled with it.

# Parameters
- **The four nodes** — the element's own geometry. They must be listed around
  the face (counter-clockwise about its normal); Define → Create Shell from 4
  Nodes derives that order from the coordinates, because a scrambled list gives
  an inverted or twisted element.
- **The plate section** — `ElasticMembranePlateSection` carries E, ν, the
  thickness h and the density. OpenSees wants a *section* for a shell, not an
  nDMaterial: the thickness is the section's business, not the material's.
- **E and ν** — the membrane stiffness is E·h/(1-ν²) and the bending stiffness
  D = E·h³/(12(1-ν²)). Note the cube: halving the thickness makes the slab eight
  times more flexible in bending and leaves the membrane behaviour almost
  unchanged.

# Mechanics
- A mesh coarse in bending is **stiffer** than reality: it is a displacement
  formulation, so it approaches the exact answer from below. Refining converges
  (the application's test suite checks exactly this against the classical plate
  solution).
- The element has six DOF per node, including a drilling rotation that carries
  no stiffness of its own. Out-of-plane and drilling DOF have to be restrained
  where the structure is a genuine plate: the portal frame wizard does it for a
  plane frame, and a wall with free edges usually needs the drilling DOF tied.
- In a 3D model a plane frame is a mechanism unless its out-of-plane DOF are
  restrained; that is what the wizard's *restrain the out-of-plane degrees of
  freedom* option is for.

        """
A fibre section is a mesh of small areas, each tied to a uniaxial material. The
element integrates the material response over the section at every integration
point along the member, so:
- **axial force and bending interact** by construction (the neutral axis moves
  as the section yields), and
- **yielding, crushing and cracking are where they physically are** (the extreme
  fibre first), not a flag switched at the whole section.

# Parameters
- **Patches** — rectangular or circular regions of one material, divided into
  `n_fib_y × n_fib_z` fibres. More fibres is more accuracy and more cost; 8×8 to
  16×16 over a rectangular section is a working range.
- **Layers** — straight rows of reinforcement, each with an area, a material and
  a position (y, z).
- **Templates** in the fibre section editor: a W-shape, and two reinforced
  concrete ones. **RC rectangular**: the confined core inside the bar centrelines,
  four unconfined cover strips, top and bottom bars and optional side bars (depth
  h along local y, width b along z, cover to the bar centres). **RC circular**:
  a confined core disc, an unconfined cover ring and bars evenly around at the
  cover. Choose the confined concrete (e.g. `Concrete04` with Mander's confined
  strength), the cover concrete and the steel.
- **Materials** — the confinement of the core (`Concrete04` with the confined
  properties) and the steel (`Steel02` with `b` for the post-yield slope) decide
  the section's ductility. The section itself has no stiffness beyond them.

# Mechanics
- A fibre section is a **nonlinear** section: it needs a non-linear static,
  pushover or transient case, with enough steps and Newton iterations. A single
  linear step will not follow it.
- Moment-curvature is the section's response; the member's moment distribution
  comes from the integration rule along its length (Assign → Frame → Beam
  Integration), which must have enough points to sample the curvature.
- The app's Material Tester runs a single material through a strain protocol —
  useful to see a `Concrete04` or `Steel02` curve before trusting a section.

# equalDOF
`equalDOF` makes a node's chosen DOF follow another node's. Uses: a rigid floor
in a 3D model (tie every node of a level to a master node in the horizontal
DOF), a hinge modelled as two coincident nodes, or a rigid link between two
points. The DOF are given as numbers, 1-based, in the order the case uses them.

Two coincident nodes tied by `equalDOF` are a **deliberate** coincidence: Edit →
Check Model for Duplicates lists them and does not merge them.

# Imposed support motion
A multiple-support case drives chosen supports with a displacement record. The
nodes must be **restrained** in the driven DOF: in the static and modal cases
they behave as ordinary supports, and the runner swaps the fix for the imposed
motion when the pattern is emitted, so the ground is at rest until the transient
starts.

The velocity series is derived from the displacement by central differences
rather than left to OpenSees. That matters when elements use `-doRayleigh`:
the damping force depends on the element's velocity, and an imposed motion
without a matching velocity loses part of the input.

These are per-case settings in Analyze → Cases. The defaults are sane; the
choice matters on large models and on models that struggle to converge.

- **Numberer** — the order the unknowns are put in. `Plain` is the model order;
  `RCM` (reverse Cuthill-McKee) and `AMD` (approximate minimum degree) reorder
  to reduce bandwidth and fill-in. On a model with thousands of DOF, AMD with a
  sparse system is often several times faster.
- **System** — how the linear system is stored and solved: `BandGeneral` and
  `ProfileSPD` for small banded problems, `SparseGeneral`/`UmfPack` for large
  sparse ones. `FullGeneral` is the reference implementation (slow, exact).
- **Algorithm** — `Linear` solves once (linear problems only); `Newton` and
  `ModifiedNewton` iterate for non-linear ones; `KrylovNewton` and
  `NewtonLineSearch` help when Newton stalls.
- **Convergence test** — an energy or residual test with a tolerance and a
  maximum number of iterations. Too tight wastes iterations; too loose accepts a
  wrong answer.
- **Eigen solver** — not a free choice: the application picks a dense solver for
  small models and ARPACK above the threshold (see Modal analysis), and
  re-executes an ARPACK case in a fresh process so the answer is reproducible.

**grid** it used, so you can keep drawing on the same lines. Cancelling the
wizard leaves the empty project.

# The wizard's values
- **Number of bays** and **bay width** — the columns sit at each bay line; the
total width is their product.
- **Eave height** — the height at which the roof starts, at the outer columns.
- **Roof** — one slope (mono-pitch), two slopes (gable) or flat; the **slope**
is a percentage. A gable rises to eave + slope × span/2 at the ridge; a
mono-pitch rises across the whole width.
- **Sections** — one for the columns, one for the rafters. If the project has
none, a default elastic section is created in the same undo step.
- **Column bases** — fixed (rotations restrained) or pinned (rotations free).
- **Plane and origin** — where the frame sits. Column tops follow the roof line,
so an interior column comes out as tall as the roof above it.

plane frame in a 3D model is a mechanism otherwise). Turn it off when you are

Eave and ridge heights, the slope and the bay width are pure geometry: they

makes a portal frame stiff) and the **sections** (bending stiffness).

# Units
PORTICO never converts: the file's `units` label says which system its numbers

…); change it if the label is wrong. **Project units** is the system the project

moments, stresses, masses, densities, spring stiffnesses and loads. A `kN-m`
file opened in `SI (m, N, kg, s, Pa)` has its forces multiplied by 1000 and its
densities in kg/m³. The **Scale** line shows the length and force factors.

Self weight is the material density times g in the project's units. PORTICO
always multiplies by 9.80665, which is only right for its own `kN-m`.

# What comes across
- Nodes, supports, support springs and nodal masses.
- Frame elements as elastic beam-columns. A section with shear areas makes a
  Timoshenko member, as in PORTICO, and the consistent mass matrix is used.
- Sections and materials: one elastic section per section, material and
  orientation used, with PORTICO's section modifiers applied to the values.
- End releases (torsion and bending) and end springs on released actions.
- Static load cases with their nodal, uniform and trapezoidal loads and self
  weight, each as a load pattern plus a linear static case of the same name.
- Prescribed support displacements, as one pattern every static case runs (as
  PORTICO imposes them in every static case).
- Load combinations and grid lines.

# Local axes
PORTICO gives a beam its local **y** up; OpenSees gives it local **z** up. Per
member the importer works out how the two triads relate and swaps `Iz`/`Iy`,
`Avy`/`Avz` and the bending releases where needed (the section name then ends in
"(axes 2-3)"). Distributed loads are re-projected onto the OpenSees axes, so they
keep their global direction.

# What it does not do (yet)
Counted in the summary and the log, never dropped silently: area elements,
diaphragms, links, the mass source, temperature loads, response spectrum cases,
translational end releases, and the cable / compression-only behaviour (such a
member arrives as an ordinary elastic member). A member with releases or a
trapezoidal load loses its shear deformation, because OpenSees' Timoshenko beam
takes neither.

nothing. Tick the load sets to envelope (by default every combination, or every
static case when there is none). A combination is expanded into sums of cases:
Linear Add adds its terms, Envelope keeps each term, and a response spectrum
case enters as plus and minus its peak. Absolute Add and SRSS combinations have
no signed demands and are skipped with a note.

Each member is read at 25 stations along its length, span loads included. The
largest axial force, moments and shears are taken together (conservative for the
interaction), and Cb comes from the major-axis moment diagram (F1-1) unless you
set it. **Set Cb = 1.0 for a cantilever**: F1-1 assumes both ends braced.

# The values the dialog asks for
- **Method** LRFD (φ) or ASD (Ω); **Fy** (50 ksi by default, in the project's
  stress unit); **ratio limit** above which a member is reported **NG**.
- **Overrides for the selected members**: the AISC shape, K about each axis, the
  unbraced length of the compression flange Lb (0 = the member length) and Cb
  (0 = from the diagram). The buckling lengths are the member length times K.

Results: one row per member with its governing ratio, the check and equation
that govern and the load set that produced them; **Select failing members**

Writes an IFC4 file (`.ifc`) with two linked descriptions of the structure, the
way BIM tools and structural programs exchange a model.

# The physical model (what BIM viewers draw)
- One building storey per storey (Define → Storeys) plus the base, each element
  in the storey it starts on.
- Frame members as **IfcColumn** (within 10° of vertical), **IfcBeam** (within
  10° of horizontal) or **IfcMember** (braces and every truss bar), extruded along
  their axis from their profile: an I or channel for an AISC section (looked up by
  its name), a rectangle, hollow or solid circle or angle from the section's
  shape, else the rectangle of the section's extent. Each carries a material
  profile set named after its section.
- Shells as **IfcSlab** (horizontal), **IfcWall** (vertical) or **IfcPlate**,
  their thickness extruded along the normal.

# The analytical model (what structural software reads)
- An IfcStructuralAnalysisModel (in-plane for a 2D model) with a point
  connection per node, its supports as boundary conditions, a curve member per
  frame or truss (end releases on the member's connection) and a surface member
  per shell with its thickness.
- One load case per Plain pattern, its action type guessed from the name (DEAD,
  LIVE, WIND, EQ …): nodal forces, uniform and trapezoidal member loads (a floor
  load as the member loads it becomes), point loads on members, shell pressures,
  imposed displacements, and the self weight as the case's self-weight
  coefficients. Load combinations become load groups of type combination with
  each case assigned by its factor.
- Every analytical member is assigned to its physical element.

- Coordinates and values stay in the project's units (metre, millimetre, foot or
  inch; newton or kip), declared in the file.

# What it does
- **Bars** longer than the target become equal pieces (a 10 m bar at 3 m becomes
  four elements of 2.5 m). The pieces inherit the section, the material and the
  element's own fields, and a distributed load follows them: each piece carries
  the same `q`, not a third of it.
- **Shells** larger than the target are subdivided ``m x n`` in their own natural
  coordinates, so a general quadrilateral is meshed without leaving its own
  edges, the winding (which the shell's normal depends on) is preserved, and two
  meshed shells of the same size share their common edge.
- **The joins** are what make the mesh usable: a bar is split at every node that
  lies on it (a column whose top lands in the middle of a beam, a frame drawn
  across a slab edge), and bars are split where they cross each other, so a
  crossing becomes a shared node instead of two members passing by.

# Values
- **Target size** — the longest edge a piece may have, in project units. It
  defaults to a tenth of the model (or of the selection).
- **Mesh** — the selection, or the whole model.
- **Tolerance** — how close a node has to be to a bar to count as lying on it, and
  how close two bars have to be to count as crossing. One part per million of the
  model is the default; loosen it for a drawing that was not drawn exactly.
- The summary under the form says what the mesh will add and replace before you
  accept it. A mesh that would add thousands of elements is one keystroke away
  from one that adds ten.

# Mechanics
Meshing changes the *discretisation*, not the structure: for a linear elastic
model, splitting a prismatic member does not change the answer (the test suite
checks a cantilever's tip deflection and a uniformly loaded beam before and
after). What it buys is resolution where the response varies — a plastic hinge, a
shell's bending — and what it costs is degrees of freedom.

A model that has been copied or imported twice accumulates coincident nodes and
repeated members, and neither is loud: the analysis runs, the deformed shape
looks right (a copy doubles the stiffness **and** the load), and only the
reactions and the member forces are wrong.

- **Coincident nodes** — groups at the same point, with the tolerance you set
  (default: one part per million of the model's size, so metres and millimetres
  need no different numbers).
- **Duplicate elements** — the same type, the same nodes and the same
  properties. These are the ones that double a stiffness.
- **Parallel elements** — the same nodes with different properties. That can be
  deliberate, so it is reported and not touched.

# What it refuses to touch
The two nodes of a **zero-length element or a bearing**, and nodes tied by an
**equalDOF** constraint, are deliberate coincidences: merging them would delete
every isolator and every modelled hinge. They are listed with the reason.

# What the repair does
- Merges into the lowest node id, **combining restraints** (a support is never
  released by accident) and keeping equal masses once (a copy must not weigh
  twice) while adding masses that differ.
- Repoints element nodes, equalDOF constraints, nodal loads and imposed-support
  node lists to the node that stays.
- Removes duplicate members and the ones left with no length, and drops loads
  that were copies instead of doubling them.
- Recomputes element duplicates **after** merging the nodes, because merging two
  nodes can turn two members into the same member.

One undo step takes the whole repair back.

Grids are drawing aids: they snap the draw tools and give you levels to work at.
They do not create nodes by themselves (unless you ask the dialog to).

# Values
- **Coordinate system** — a name, an origin and a rotation. `Global` is at the
  world origin with identity rotation and cannot be deleted.
- **System type** — *Cartesian* (X, Y and Z lines) or *Cylindrical* (radial):
  the three tabs become **R** (rings: radii about the system's local Z axis),
  **T** (radial lines: angles in degrees from local +X towards +Y) and **Z**
  (levels). Rings close into full circles when the radial lines go all the way
  round (e.g. 8 lines at 45°), otherwise they are arcs between the first and
  last angle. The draw tools snap to the ring × radial-line crossings.
- **Grid lines per axis** — each line has an id (its label), an ordinate,
  Primary/Secondary, visibility, the end its label is shown at (**Start**,
  **End** or **Both**) and a colour. The ordinates are what the tools snap to; a
  line whose Visibility is off is neither drawn nor snapped to.
- **Add Row** continues the grid: the new line goes one *last spacing* beyond
  the last line (lines at 0, 6, 12 → 18) and takes the next id (X3 → X4, C → D,
  Z → AA). Edit it if that is not where you want it.
- Lines are per axis: X lines are planes of constant X, and so on.
- **Hide All Grid Lines** — the system is neither drawn nor snapped to (the same
  switch as View → Show Grids and the right-click menu).

# Grid labels
- **Show grid labels** — the bubbles at the ends of the lines.
- **Content** — `ID` (A, 1, X3), `ID + coordinate` (`A (6)`) or `Coordinate`.
  A radial line shows its angle with a degree sign.
- **Size** (points) and **Colour** of the label text.
- **Position** + *Apply to all lines* — put every label at the Start, the End or
  Both ends at once (each row can still be changed on its own).
- Z levels are labelled once, beside the first corner of the plan.

# Working plane
- View → Top (XY), Front (XZ) or Right (YZ) chooses which pair of axes is the
  drawing plane, and the Level combo chooses which level of the third axis is
  active. A cylindrical grid offers its Z levels in plan (Top) only.

For a regular grid you do not want to type line by line. One undo step.

# Values
- **Put it in** — a new coordinate system, or *Replace the grid of* an existing
  one (its origin and rotation are kept). A new project's empty Global grid is
  offered first.
- **New system name** and **Origin** — only for a new system.
- **Grid type** — *Cartesian* (X lines, Y lines, Z levels) or *Cylindrical*
  (rings by radius, radial lines by angle in degrees, Z levels). A 2D model is
  Cartesian in the X-Z plane, so its Y row is off.
- Per row: **Number** of lines (0 = none on that axis), **Spacing**, where the
  **First** line is, and the **Names**: `A, B, C …`, `1, 2, 3 …` or `X1, X2 …`.
- **Labels** — on/off, content (ID, ID + coordinate, coordinate) and position
  (Start, End, Both); size and colour are in the grid dialog.

The preview lists the lines before anything is created. Rings need radii of 0 or
more, and the radial lines cannot go past a full turn: 8 lines at 45° close the
circle, 9 would put two on top of each other.

Afterwards, Define → Coordinate System/Grids edits any line one by one.

  is not snapped to either, so the draw tools then land on the working plane.

  with the model and Ctrl+Z undoes it.

  hide one coordinate system and keep the others, the grid dialogs, Grid Line
  View and the standard views.

the **window** either side of it and the elements all of whose joints are kept.
Everything else is hidden from the view (not from the model: the analysis and
the tables still see all of it).

# Values
- **Grid line** — every line of every coordinate system, by system, axis, id and
  ordinate.
- **Window either side** — how far from the line a joint may be, in the model's
  length unit. Default **50 mm** (0.05 in a model in m, 50 in mm, converted for
  ft and in). The dialog remembers the last value and counts what will be shown.

# What the view does
- An X line is looked at from the Right (YZ), a Y line from the Front (XZ) and a
  Z level from the Top (XY), with that line as the working plane, so you can
  draw on it straight away. A ring or radial line keeps the isometric view.
- The filter follows the model while you work: a member drawn on the line
  appears, one moved off it disappears. The status bar says what is shown.
- **View → Show All Objects** (or the right-click menu) brings everything back.
  Opening another project does too.

Builds the nodes and the `truss` bars of a plane truss into the open project,

  **Warren with verticals**.

- **Top chord** — parallel to the bottom chord, **pitched** to a ridge at
  mid-span (with its own depth at the supports), or **triangular** (closed at

  point sits at the ridge; a pitched Warren an odd number, so a top node does.

- **Plane**, **Origin**, and whether to restrain the out-of-plane translation.

# Mechanics
The left end is pinned and the right end on a roller, so the truss is
statically determinate externally. A truss bar has no bending stiffness, so in
a frame model (ndf 3 or 6) the rotations of every truss node are restrained;
connect it to frames afterwards only through nodes you free again. The bars
take the **unit weight** on the Members page (steel by default), so the DEAD
case carries them: half of each bar's weight goes to each of its joints.

  - deterioration (plastic hinges): `ModIMKPeakOriented`, `ModIMKPinching`,
    `Bilin`, `Pinching4` (a symmetric envelope);
  - dampers and rate models: `ViscousDamper`, `BilinearOilDamper`, `Viscous`,

    `Series` (strains added), `MinMax` (failure outside a strain range),
    `InitStrainMaterial`, `InitStressMaterial`, `Fatigue`. A wrapper is emitted

  `PlasticDamageConcretePlaneStress`, and the plate wrappers a layered shell needs:
  `PlateFiber` (of a 3D material), `PlateFromPlaneStress` (of a plane-stress
  concrete, with its out-of-plane shear modulus) and `PlateRebar` (a uniaxial
  steel at an angle).

Every form row shows the parameter's OpenSees name and meaning; each material is
checked against the live solver, and the Material Tester runs any uniaxial one
(a wrapper together with what it wraps).

  peak), `fpcu`/`epsU` (crushing), and the Popovics parameters. For a confined
  core, use the confined strength and strain.
- `Elastic`: `E`. Everything else follows from the section.

  Optional **shear areas As2 / As3** (0 = none) add shear deformation: an elastic
  beam-column on such a section runs as an `ElasticTimoshenkoBeam`
  (needs G; a 3D member needs both). OpenSees 3.8 loads that element with
  full-length uniform loads (and self weight) only, so point, partial and
  trapezoidal loads on it are refused, and it takes no `-release`: a released end
  uses the hidden-node route instead. The member deflects by
  `P L³ / (3 E I) + P L / (G As)` on a cantilever; the Property Modifiers' shear
  areas scale As2 / As3.
- **Fibre section** — patches and rebar layers tied to uniaxial materials. It
  yields and cracks where the material does, and needs a non-linear case.
- **Section aggregator** — several responses (axial, bending, shear, torsion)
  combined into one section, each with its own material or section.
- **Plate section** (shell) — E, ν, thickness h and density ρ.
- **LayeredShell** (shell) — a table of layers, each a plate material and a
  thickness, from one face to the other: concrete layers (`PlateFromPlaneStress`
  of `PlasticDamageConcretePlaneStress`, or `PlateFiber`) and rebar layers
  (`PlateRebar` at 0° or 90°, thickness = bar area per unit width). At least three
  layers. OpenSees integrates each layer at its mid-plane, so n equal layers give
  1 - 1/n² of the bending stiffness: use several thin layers (10 or more) through
  a concrete wall or slab.
- **PlateFiber** (shell) — one plate material through the thickness h.

# AISC v16 shapes
"Add from AISC…" picks a shape by name (1,660 of them, 13 families). The values
are the published US-customary ones; the dialog shows the published value *and*
the converted one, and E and G remain your choice, because a shape is geometry,
not a material. The data comes from Steel Construction Manual values and was
cross-checked against an independent source before being committed.

Which inertia is strong depends on the project. A 2D frame bends in the x-y plane
about local z, so the table's strong-axis `Ix` becomes **Iz**. A 3D beam stands
with its depth along local z (local z is vertical for a horizontal member), so
gravity bends it about local y and `Ix` becomes **Iy**, with the table's `Iy` as
Iz. A fibre profile is turned upright the same way in 3D. The dialog's preview
shows the values it will insert. Sections inserted by builds before 0.0.11 into a
3D project have the two swapped: re-insert them, or swap Iy and Iz by hand.

`ndm`, `ndf`, and `tag`, the first of the 1000 tags reserved for that block (from

The code runs on this computer with your permissions. When you open a file that

disables them until you enable them here. Running a project file with the

script you run.

- With an enabled block, the "no element stiffens this DOF" check is skipped

  singular model.
- Results are recorded only for the joints and elements of the model; an element
  a block adds shows up in the joints' displacements and reactions.

A `Plain` pattern holds the nodal loads and the distributed element loads
applied together, and points at a time series that scales them in time. Cases
reference patterns by id, so the same loads can be used by several cases.

- One pattern per load type (dead, live, wind, earthquake) is the usual
  arrangement: a static case can then combine them, and a transient can apply
  gravity first and the earthquake after `loadConst`.
- A load pattern with no loads is legal but does nothing.

# Self weight
- **Self-weight multiplier** — 1 adds the weight of every frame whose section
  has a **unit weight** (gamma, force per volume, set in the Section Library):
  gamma times A per unit length, downward (-Z, in 2D and in 3D), split over the
  member's local axes, so a column takes it axially and a sloped rafter partly
  axially. 0 leaves it out.
- A new project starts with a **DEAD** case: a time series, a pattern with a
  self-weight multiplier of 1 and a linear static analysis that runs it. The
  default section is steel (gamma = 77 kN/m³), so a frame drawn on a fresh
  model already has a gravity result. A **plate section** (shell) has a unit
  weight too: each ShellMITC4 takes gamma times h per unit area as consistent
  nodal forces over its real shape.
- A **fiber section** has a unit weight too, applied to its gross area (patches
  plus bars plus loose fibres: an RC section comes out heavier by its steel
  ratio, 1-3 %). An **aggregator** weighs what the section it wraps weighs.
- **Trusses** and **BeamWithHinges** members carry their own unit weight (in the
  Properties panel): a truss bar sends half its weight to each joint, a
  BeamWithHinges member takes gamma times its elastic area A per length.
  Assign → Frame → Hinge keeps the member's weight per length. 2D quads,
  zero-length elements, bearings and links carry no self weight.

            "Factored sums and envelopes of the results of analysis cases.",
            """
A load combination combines the **stored results** of analysis cases; it never
runs a solver of its own. A combination can include Static and Response Spectrum
cases, and other combinations (an envelope of the strength combinations, for
instance). Each included case has a scale factor.

# The four types
- **Linear Add** — the factored sum, 1.2·DEAD + 1.6·LIVE. Superposition: valid
  only when the cases respond linearly.
- **Envelope** — the maximum and the minimum over the included cases, value by
  value. Valid for any case, linear or not.
- **Absolute Add** — the sum of the magnitudes.
- **SRSS** — the square root of the sum of the squares.

# Maximum and minimum
Every result has an upper and a lower value. A static case has one value (both
are the same); a response spectrum result is a peak, so it counts as plus and
minus that peak. A Linear Add of static cases therefore has one value; an
envelope, an SRSS, an Absolute Add, or anything that includes a spectrum has a
maximum and a minimum. With a negative scale factor the two swap.

Element forces are enveloped as **internal forces**, the sign the force diagram
draws, so the diagram of the maximum is the upper envelope of the case diagrams.
The results table lists each end force as OpenSees reports it (localForce), with
its maximum and minimum.

# What a combination contains
Only what every included case provides. A response spectrum case provides
displacements, reactions, element forces and shell resultants: each is the SRSS
or CQC of the response to the equivalent static load of every mode, a peak
magnitude, so it counts as plus and minus that peak. A spectrum result stored
before it had forces gives displacements only: run the case again.

# Warnings
A Linear Add, Absolute Add or SRSS that includes a case solved with an iterative
algorithm (Newton, …), or a model with P-Delta or corotational transformations,
is applied with a warning: adding nonlinear responses is not the response to the
added loads. Run the summed loads as one case instead, or use an Envelope.
Material nonlinearity is not detected.

# Running a combination
Analyze → Run lists the combinations after the cases. Running one runs only the
cases it needs that have no current results (in one analysis process), then
combines. A result stays current until the model changes; editing a combination
does not make results stale. Display → Show Results Of… switches between stored
results without running anything.

# Generating the combinations of a design code
**Generate from a design code…** adds the combinations of ASCE 7-16 (LRFD or
ASD), EN 1990 or TS 500 / TBDY 2018 from cases you tag with the load they carry:
Dead, Live, Roof live, Snow, Rain, Wind and Earthquake (the tag is guessed from
the case name). The result is an ordinary set of Linear Add combinations: edit,
copy or delete them. Wind and static earthquake cases are added in both signs; a
response spectrum case is already plus and minus, so it is added once. An
envelope over each generated group is added too (one per group, so the ultimate
and serviceability limit states of EN 1990 do not mix). Roles a code does not use
are named after the run.

**Create the missing load cases** (on by default) gives every load the code uses
that no case is tagged with an empty load case of its own before generating:
LIVE, ROOF LIVE, SNOW, RAIN, WIND X and WIND Y, EQ X and EQ Y (one wind and one
earthquake case along X in a 2D model), and DEAD with the self weight if there is
no dead case. Each is a Plain pattern with a linear time series and a linear
static case, all named after the load; the dialog lists what it would create.
Their patterns start empty: assign the loads before running. Undo removes the
cases and the combinations together.

The factors are the code's. Judgement stays yours: the occupancy-dependent
live-load reduction, favourable versus unfavourable permanent action, the
national annex.

**Earthquake: 100% + 30% orthogonal rule** applies to any code: with two or more
earthquake cases, each acts at 100% with the others at 30% (±Ex ± 0.3Ey and
±0.3Ex ± Ey).

## ASCE 7-16 LRFD (Section 2.3.1)
- 1.4D
- 1.2D + 1.6L + 0.5(Lr or S or R)
- 1.2D + 1.6(Lr or S or R) + (L or 0.5W)

- 1.2D + 1.0E + L + 0.2S
- 0.9D + 1.0W
- 0.9D + 1.0E

The live-load factor in the last combinations is 1.0: the 0.5 exception depends
on the occupancy.

## ASCE 7-16 ASD (Section 2.4.1)
- D; D + L; D + (Lr or S or R); D + 0.75L + 0.75(Lr or S or R)

## EN 1990
- **Ultimate, equation 6.10**: 1.35G + 1.5Q1 + Σ 1.5 ψ0,i Qi, with each variable
  action (imposed, roof, snow, wind) leading in turn, and 1.35G alone. With
  *favourable permanent action* the set is repeated with 1.0G (uplift,
  overturning).
- **Seismic (accidental), 6.11b**: G + E + Σ ψ2,i Qi.
- **Serviceability**: characteristic G + Q1 + Σ ψ0,i Qi; frequent
  G + ψ1,1 Q1 + Σ ψ2,i Qi; quasi-permanent G + Σ ψ2,i Qi.

The ψ factors are those of Table A1.1: the *imposed load category* (A to H) sets
them for Live cases, roofs (Lr) are category H, wind is 0.6 / 0.2 / 0, snow is
0.5 / 0.2 / 0 (0.7 / 0.5 / 0.2 above 1000 m). Rain has no EN 1990 factors and is
not used.

## TS 500 / TBDY 2018
- 1.4G + 1.6Q
- G + nQ ± E and 0.9G ± E (TBDY 2018), with n the *live load participation* (1.0
  by default; Table 4.3 of the code gives 0.3 for housing and offices)
- G + 1.3Q ± 1.3W and 0.9G ± 1.3W (TS 500)

Roof live, snow and rain cases are not used. Check the factors against the

A restraint removes a DOF from the unknowns: a fixed DOF carries a reaction

# Values
- **Ux, Uy, Uz** — translations; **Rx, Ry, Rz** — rotations. A 2D model lives in

  Ux and Uz.

  translation free), and so on. The check boxes are what is actually applied.

  stiffness matrix is singular and the run fails with a solver error. That is
  what "the model is unstable" usually means.
- A fixed rotation is a moment connection; leaving it free makes the connection
  a pin. In a portal frame that difference decides whether the frame sways like a

A support spring ties a joint to the ground through a stiffness instead of a
fixed restraint: soil springs under a footing (Winkler), a flexible column base,
a bearing pad, or a lateral prop.

# Values
- One **k** per DOF of the model (a 2D frame: Ux, Uz, Ry), in force per length
  for a translation and moment per radian for a rotation, in the model's units.
  Zero means no spring. OK replaces the springs of every selected joint; all
  zero removes them.

# How it is analysed
- Each sprung joint gets a hidden ground node, fixed in every DOF, joined to it by
  a `zeroLength` element with one elastic material per sprung DOF, along the
  global axes.
- The spring force is reported as the joint's **reaction**, so the reactions
  still balance the loads. Springs also stiffen a modal analysis (a mass m on a
  spring k vibrates at √(k/m)).
- A DOF that is also restrained ignores its spring.
- The canvas draws a green zigzag under a sprung joint. IFC export writes the
  stiffness into the support's boundary condition.

  A mass of zero in a direction means that direction carries no inertia.
- Masses are what a modal or a transient case needs. A static case ignores them.
- Gravity is not a mass: an acceleration record acts on the mass (`-accel`), so a
  model with no mass has nothing for an earthquake to shake.

# Mechanics
- The period of a mode is T = 2π√(M/K): the mass you assign is the M half of
  that. Getting it wrong scales every period (and every spectral demand read at
  those periods).
- A common convention is to lump the seismic mass of a floor at its master node,
  which is also where equalDOF ties the floor together.

The first node selected is the **retained** (master) node, the second the
**constrained** (slave), and the DOF you tick are the ones tied. Uses: a rigid
floor, a rigid link, a hinge made of two coincident nodes.

# Values
- **DOF numbers** — 1-based, in the order the model uses them. A 3D frame: 1 = Ux,
  2 = Uy, 3 = Uz, 4 = Rx, 5 = Ry, 6 = Rz. A 2D model lives in the X-Z plane: a 2D
  frame has 1 = Ux, 2 = Uz, 3 = Ry, a 2D truss 1 = Ux and 2 = Uz. The dialog lists
  the model's own.
- Ticking 1 and 2 on a pair of nodes at the same level is a diaphragm in plan.

# Mechanics
Tying DOF removes them from the unknowns: the constrained node's displacement is
whatever the retained node's is. It does not add stiffness anywhere else — a
rigid floor is also, physically, a constraint that distributes horizontal force,
which is exactly what this does.

A node takes one constraint, and constraints do not chain: a node an equalDOF
constrains may retain another equalDOF or rigid link only when its own equalDOF
ties every DOF. OpenSees' Transformation handler (every eigen analysis uses it)
solves any other chain, a node constrained twice, or a loop without an error
into wrong results, so the model check refuses them. Tie each node straight to
one retained node instead.

A frame end released at the constrained node is made without a further
constraint, as at a diaphragm joint (see Assign → Frame → Releases/Partial
Fixity).

# Mechanics
A nodal load is applied at a node; it does not depend on the members touching
it. A load on a node with no stiffness in that direction (an unrestrained node
that only touches trusses, say) produces a singular system rather than a large
displacement, so the solver's refusal is a modelling message, not a failure of
the solver.

  axes. As for a distributed load, gravity on a horizontal member is usually a
  negative Py.
- **Distance from end i** — where the load acts, either **relative** (a
  fraction of the length, 0 at node i, 1 at node j) or **absolute** (a length).
  An absolute distance becomes a different fraction on members of different

# Mechanics
It is emitted as `eleLoad -beamPoint`. An elastic beam-column takes the exact
fixed-end forces; a force- or displacement-based element resolves the load
through its integration points, so the end forces are approximate unless the
member is split at the load (Edit → Mesh keeps the load on the piece it falls
on). A force-based element only takes an element load into its forces after
a solve, so the runner follows each static step that loads one with a second
solve at the same load; any algorithm and test then gives the converged answer,
except a test relative to the first iteration (RelativeNormDispIncr), which is
refused for more than one step.

# Values
- **Torsion (T), M2, M3** at **end i** and **end j** — a released action carries
  no force at that end. M3 is the moment about local 3 (local z), the in-plane
  moment of a 2D frame; M2 the moment about local 2 (local y). A 2D frame
  releases M3 only.
- **Spring** — a partial-fixity stiffness (moment per radian) on a released
  action; 0 is a full release. The end then carries `k × relative rotation`.
- Torsion released at both ends leaves the member free to spin about its own
  axis and is refused unless one end has a spring.
- A joint where every member releases the same rotation and nothing restrains
  it is unstable: the run stops and names the joint and DOF.

# Mechanics
OpenSees has no release option on force- or displacement-based elements, and
the 3D elastic element's `-releasez/-releasey` gets the end moments of a
`-beamPoint` load wrong, so the member end is connected to a hidden node at the
joint instead: `equalDOF` ties the translations and every kept rotation, a
`zeroLength` element along the member's axes carries the springs. A member whose
local axes are skewed to the global axes and that keeps torsion while releasing
both moments gets a penalty spring 10^8 times its own rotational stiffness for
the torsion (an elastic member only; a fibre member is asked to release torsion
too). The hidden nodes' reactions are added to the joint's.

A release at an end that also has an end offset or an insertion point acts at
the face of the rigid zone, as in SAP2000: the hidden node hangs off the joint
with `rigidLink beam`, and such a model runs with the Transformation constraint
handler even if the case asks for Plain (Plain ignores a rigid link).

At a joint that a rigid diaphragm, an equalDOF or a rigid link constrains, a
hidden node tied by `equalDOF` would chain through that constraint, which
OpenSees solves wrong without an error; there the release is made inside the
element or with penalty springs instead (see Assign → Joint → Diaphragm).

- **Rigid-zone factor** — the part of each offset that is rigid (0 to 1). The
  flexible length is `L - factor × (length i + length j)`.
- **Automatic from connectivity** — instead of typed lengths, each end takes the
  largest half-extent, measured along this member, of the section of the other
  frame members that meet it at that joint (SAP2000 "automatic from
  connectivity"): a 0.4 m column gives a beam 0.2 m at that end. Members parallel
  to it and members whose section size is unknown add nothing. The lengths are
  worked out once, when you press OK, and stored like typed ones (change the
  geometry and assign again).

# Mechanics
The rigid zones are `geomTransf ... -jntOffset`, so they add no DOF. The end
forces, and the force diagrams, are those of the flexible part, at the faces of
the rigid zones. Loads are still given along the whole joint-to-joint length:
the part on a rigid zone goes straight to its joint as a force and the moment of
that force about the joint. A 3D Corotational transformation ignores joint
offsets in OpenSees 3.8, so the combination is refused.

values of a native trapezoidal load, and `dispBeamColumn` drops it with a
warning). A force-based element takes the native
`-beamUniform wa ... aL bL wb ...`, integrated at its integration points (exact
for a full-length load on an elastic section). A part on a rigid end zone goes
to the joint.

  zone, one per end; the interior uses the member's own section.

# The five types
- **Static** — equilibrium under the patterns' loads, in N steps. See
  **Static analysis**.
- **Modal** — eigenvalues and mode shapes; needs mass. See **Modal analysis**.
- **Pushover** — displacement-controlled monotonic push to a target. See
  **Pushover**.
- **Transient** — time integration of a ground motion or a time series. See
  **Transient analysis**.
- **Response spectrum** — modal maxima combined by SRSS or CQC. See
  **Response spectrum**.

# Options that apply to most types
- **Steps** and, for a transient, **dt**.
- **Numberer, system, algorithm, convergence test** — see Numberer, system and
  solver. The defaults are chosen to work; change them for size or for a case
  that struggles. Every option of OpenSeesPy 3.8 that runs is offered:

    displacement and energy tests in OpenSees 3.8: pair them with NormDispIncr),
    NormDispAndUnbalance and NormDispOrUnbalance (the tolerance is used for both
    norms) and FixedNumIter (exactly the max iterations; do not pair it with
    SecantNewton, which divides by zero once converged);

Builds the model exactly as an analysis would, assembles its stiffness matrix
once and looks for **mechanisms**: motions of the free joints that no member,
spring or support resists. A statically stable model has none, and its
stiffness matrix has full rank; a model with a mechanism cannot be solved, or
solves into nonsense.

The check runs in the same child process as an analysis, so a model OpenSees
cannot even build does not take the window with it.

# What it reports
- **Free DOFs that no element stiffens** — a joint DOF that nothing connects
  to: a rotation of a truss joint in a frame model, a joint whose every member
  releases the same moment, a node on its own.
- **Mechanisms** — each one lists the joints and DOFs that move the most in it,
  with their share of the motion (+1.00 is the largest). A frame without
  bracing or base fixity sways; a beam on two rollers slides; a chain of hinges
  folds. In a 2D model the DOFs are Ux, Uz and Ry (the X-Z plane).

The joints that move are selected in the view, so you can see where to add a
support, a brace or a member, or which DOF to restrain.

# How it decides
The stiffness matrix is decomposed into singular values. A singular value
below 1e-11 of the largest is a zero: its vector is a mechanism. Constraints
(equalDOF, rigid links, diaphragms) are applied first, so a DOF a constraint
ties is not counted twice. The check reads the initial stiffness: a model that
only becomes unstable as it yields or buckles needs a nonlinear analysis.

Draws the element force component you pick (N, V2, V3, T, M2, M3) as a diagram

# Reading it
- The end-j sign is flipped internally so a diagram is continuous across an
  element: a jump at a joint means a real discontinuity (a hinge, a point load,
  or two members with different sections).
- A member under span loads (uniform, point, trapezoidal, self weight) is drawn
  with **intermediate stations**: the internal forces follow from the end forces
  and the loads by statics, so the moment is parabolic under a uniform load and
  piecewise linear under point loads, with the shear jumping at each point, and
  the largest value between the ends is labelled. A member without a span load
  stays a straight line between its ends. Stations are drawn for the results of a
  static case; a combination or envelope (whose cases are not at hand) draws
  straight lines between the ends.
- Diagrams are drawn **between the two ends of a line element**. Shells, quads
  and other face elements have no two-end station, so they are skipped rather
  than drawn wrongly; if no line element returned forces the log says so.
- The values come from the analysis results, not from a hand calculation: what
  you see is what the solver computed.

            """
Paints one quantity on the shell faces, with a colour bar, on the results of the
last static analysis.

# What can be shown
- **Deformation** — `|u|`, `ux`, `uy`, `uz`. These warp the mesh, so the colour
  and the shape say the same thing; the scale box multiplies the displacement
  (`0` paints the undeformed model).
- **Membrane** — `N11`, `N22`, `N12` and the principal values `N1`, `N2`
  (force per unit length).
- **Bending** — `M11`, `M22`, `M12` and `M1`, `M2` (moment per unit length).
- **Shear** — `V13`, `V23` and their magnitude `V`.

# Principal values and directions
`N1`/`N2` and `M1`/`M2` are the eigenvalues of the symmetric 2×2 membrane and
bending tensors — Mohr's circle, computed in `core.shell_results`. They do not
depend on the element's local axes, which is why they are the right thing to
read a design from: the frame of the mesh is arbitrary, the principal value is
not. Turning on **Draw principal directions** adds one segment per element
through its centroid, along the major principal axis, with a length proportional
to the spread between the two values — where the two are equal there is no
direction, and nothing is drawn.

# Limits worth knowing
- A field is painted on the **shell faces** (`ShellMITC4`, quads). Bars are not
  part of the map, and a model without shells cannot show one.
- Values are the **section stress resultants** OpenSees reports, averaged over
  the element's gauss points and onto the nodes for a continuous picture. They
  are per unit length, so a membrane force reads `N/m` (or `kip/in`) and a
  moment `N·m/m` (or `kip·in/in`).
- A **frame model has nothing to paint**: bars have no section resultants, so
  the contour needs at least one shell or quad. The command says so instead of
  showing an empty map.

- Change it to read a result in another system (a kN·m moment as kip·ft, for
  instance) without touching the model. Every open result view is refreshed on
  the spot: diagram values, displacement tables and curves all move together
  with their unit labels.
- Forces, moments (force × length) and stresses (force / length²) each convert
  with the factors their combination implies, so the numbers stay physical.
- It is also the system used when a dialog converts a value that arrives from
  outside (an imperial shape into the project).
- See **Units and the solver** for why the application never converts the numbers
  you type.

A storey is a floor level: a name and an elevation along the vertical axis, Z
(in 2D and in 3D). The storey table, the "every joint of storey N" diaphragm and the
drift ratios all read them.

# Values
- **Name**, **Elevation** — one row per floor. Everything below the lowest
  storey is the **base**, whose elevation is the lowest node of the model.
- **From Z grid lines** — one storey per Z line of the chosen coordinate system,
  the lowest line being the base (Story1, Story2... as ETABS names them). Rows
  already there keep their ids, so diaphragms that follow a storey keep it.

# Notes
- A storey's **height** is the distance to the storey (or base) below it: the
  inter-storey drift ratio divides by it.
- A joint belongs to a storey when it lies on its elevation, to a millionth of
  the model's height.
- A storey used by a diaphragm cannot be removed; delete the diaphragm first
  (Assign → Joint → Remove Constraints on its retained node).

A group is a name, a colour and the joints and elements it holds, as in SAP2000

later. A joint or an element can belong to any number of groups.

# Values

  a group never deletes its joints or elements.

# Notes
- Deleting a joint or an element takes it out of every group; Undo puts it back.
  Fixing duplicates moves a merged joint's membership to the joint that is kept.

A section cut, as in SAP2000, sums the end forces of a group's **elements** at
the group's **joints**, with the moments taken about the centroid of those joints
or about a point you type. Put in the group the elements the cut passes through
and the joints on the side you want the force at:

- the columns of a storey and their base joints: the storey (or pier) shear,
  axial force and overturning moment;
- a wall's shells and the joints of one edge: the force through that edge.

# Values
- **Name** — unique. **Group** — from Define → Groups.
- **Centre X, Y, Z** — the point the moments are about; leave all three empty
  for the centroid of the cut joints.

# Results
A static case gets a **Section cuts** tab in the Results panel: the six global
components Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz (a 2D model: F1, F3, M2) at the final step.
The sign is that of the loads on the elements' side of the cut: a cantilever
column with a lateral load P and a weight W at its top, cut at its base, reports
+P and -W. Checked against hand statics in 2D and 3D.

# Notes
- Re-run the cases after adding or changing a cut. Pushover, transient and
  response spectrum cases, and load combinations, do not report cuts yet.
- A group a cut uses cannot be removed; delete the cut first.
- An element of the group that touches no joint of the group adds nothing; two
  group elements meeting at a free group joint cancel.

Computes the equivalent lateral force (ELF) loads of ASCE/SEI 7-16 or TBDY 2018

`EQ X`, `EQ Y` and, with accidental eccentricity, `EQ X +e`, `EQ X -e`,
`EQ Y +e`, `EQ Y -e`. A Plain pattern already named that way (for instance the
empty `EQ X` the combination generator creates) gets its nodal loads replaced, so
the cases and combinations that use it keep working. Everything is one undo step.

# Values
- **Code** — ASCE/SEI 7-16 §12.8 or TBDY 2018 §4.7. SDS, SD1, S1 and TL are taken
  from the project's design spectrum (Ground Motions → Target spectrum) when it has
  one.
- **SDS, SD1** (g) — the design spectral accelerations. **S1** (ASCE) only drives
  the near-fault minimum of Eq. 12.8-6. **TL** — the long-period transition.
- **R** and **Ie** (ASCE) or **R**, **I** and **D** (TBDY) — the structural system's
  coefficients. They are yours to choose; the generator only applies the formulas.
- **Period T** — typed, or **Approximate**: ASCE Ta = Ct hn^x (Table 12.8-2) or
  TBDY T = Ct H^(3/4) for the chosen system, with the height of the model. A
  modal period can be typed in; ASCE limits it to Cu Ta, which is left to you.
- **Directions** — X and/or Y (a 2D model lives in the X-Z plane: X only).
- **Accidental eccentricity ±** — the storey force moved by ± the ratio (5 %)
  times the floor's extent across the load (3D).

# How it is computed
- **ASCE 7-16**: Cs = SDS / (R/Ie), at most SD1 / (T R/Ie) (or SD1 TL / (T² R/Ie)
  past TL), at least max(0.044 SDS Ie, 0.01) and, for S1 ≥ 0.6 g,
  0.5 S1 / (R/Ie). V = Cs W, and Fx = V wx hx^k / Σ wi hi^k with k = 1 up to
  0.5 s, 2 from 2.5 s and linear between. The preview names the clause that
  governs.
- **TBDY 2018**: Vt = W SaR(T) with SaR = Sae(T) / Ra(T), Ra = R/I past TB and
  D + (R/I - D) T/TB below it, and Vt ≥ 0.04 I SDS W. ΔFN = 0.0075 N Vt acts
  at the top; the rest is shared as Fi = (Vt - ΔFN) wi Hi / Σ wj Hj.
- **Weights** are the masses the analysis uses (typed masses, Define → Mass
  Source, diaphragm lumping) times g, at the storeys (Define → Storeys) or, with
  none defined, at every elevation above the base that carries mass. Heights are
  from the base. Mass that lies off the storey levels is left out of W, and the
  preview says how much.
- **Where the force goes**: to a horizontal diaphragm's retained node when that is
  where the floor's mass is (with the eccentricity as a torque F e about Z), else
  to the floor's joints in proportion to their mass (tilted so that the resultant
  acts e off the centre of mass).

Run the `EQ X` / `EQ Y` cases like any other static case, and combine them with
Define → Load Combinations (the code generators take them as Earthquake loads).

            """
The mass source is SAP2000's and ETABS': instead of typing a mass at every
joint, the solver gets **W / g** of what you choose. Masses typed with Assign →
Joint → Masses always count on top.

# Values
- **Element self mass** — frames and shells whose section has a unit weight,
  lumped half on each end of a frame and by tributary area on a shell's corners.
- **Load patterns** — tick a pattern and give its factor (the usual D + 0.3 L
  is DEAD 1.0, LIVE 0.3). Only the **downward** part of its nodal, uniform and
  point loads counts, plus its self-weight multiplier; element loads go to the
  element's ends. A node whose total comes out upward gets nothing.
- **Also on the vertical translation** — by default the mass goes on the
  lateral translations only, so the model has no vertical modes.
- **Lump at the retained node** — each rigid diaphragm's in-plane mass and its
  rotational inertia sum(m r²) move to the retained node, where the storey table
  and mass participation report them.

# Mechanics
Lumping is exact only when the retained node sits at the centre of that mass;
otherwise the rigid-body mass couples translation and rotation, which a lumped
mass cannot express, so such a diaphragm keeps its mass on the joints (the
constraint carries it exactly). The periods are the same either way. A restrained
DOF gets no mass: it never moves, and it would only dilute the mass ratios.

A pattern that carries self weight together with **Element self mass** counts
the self weight twice; the dialog warns about it.

Every constrained joint follows the **retained** node in the two in-plane
translations and the rotation about the perpendicular axis; the out-of-plane
DOF stay free, so slabs still bend and columns still shorten.

# Values
- **Joints** — every joint of a storey (resolved when the model is built, so
  joints drawn later join the floor; supports in the plane are left out), or the
  selected joints.
- **Perpendicular axis** — Z for a floor; X or Y for a vertical rigid plane.
- **Retained node** — a new node at the centre of mass of the joints (their
  effective mass, the mass source included), or an existing selected node.

# Mechanics
A retained node that no element touches has no stiffness out of its plane: the
runner fixes those three DOF itself, OpenSees' own recipe. A case left at the
**Plain** constraint handler runs with **Transformation**: Plain drops a
diaphragm with a warning and then solves a singular system without reporting
failure. A joint can belong to one diaphragm only, and not also be the
constrained node of an equalDOF or rigid link; a joint out of the plane is
refused (OpenSees would silently drop it).

A joint of the diaphragm may not **retain** another constraint either: no
equalDOF or rigid link retained by it. The Transformation handler cannot chain
such constraints (it keeps one per node and numbers the chained one wrong) and
gives wrong results without an error, so the model check refuses them; leave
that joint out of the floor.

**Frame end releases** at a diaphragm joint work, without such a chain:

- an elastic beam-column with an elastic section is released inside the element
  (`-releasez` / `-releasey` for M3 / M2, a zero `G J` for torsion), exactly, and
  at the face of a rigid end zone when the end is offset;
- any other member with elastic properties (and an elastic beam-column with a
  point, partial or trapezoidal load, a consistent mass matrix, or partial
  fixity at that end, which OpenSees cannot condense) hangs the end off a hidden
  node held by penalty springs 10^5 times the member's own stiffness: results
  within about 10^-7 of the exact ones;
- a fibre member, or such a spring-held end with an end offset, is refused with
  a remedy.

The canvas draws the diaphragm as spokes from the retained node (a small cube).
Deleting the retained node deletes the diaphragm.

# Values
- **beam** — the constrained node moves with the retained one as a rigid body:
  its translations include the rotation times the lever arm, and its rotations
  equal the retained node's. Needs rotations (ndf 3 in 2D, 6 in 3D).
- **bar** — only the translations are tied, as an inextensible bar would.
- **Retained / constrained node** — the two selected joints.

# Mechanics
Like a diaphragm, a rigid link is a constraint the Plain handler cannot enforce,
so the case runs with Transformation. The canvas draws it as a thick orange bar.

The retained node must not itself be constrained (unless by an equalDOF of every
DOF), and the constrained node takes no other constraint: see equalDOF. Two rigid
beam links in a row are one rigid link from the first node to the last.

A frame end released at the constrained node is made without a further
constraint, as at a diaphragm joint (see Assign → Frame → Releases/Partial
Fixity).

With storeys defined, the Results panel shows a **Storeys** tab (exported to CSV
at full precision like every table): top storey first, the base last.

# What each column is
- **U** — the storey's lateral displacement: the retained node of its diaphragm,
  or the mean of its joints when it has none.
- **Drift** — (U of the storey - U of the level below) / storey height.
- **Shear** — static case: the force the members cut just above the level below
  carry, from their global end forces. Base row: minus the sum of the lateral
  reactions, the base shear.
- **Response spectrum** — each mode's displacement, drift and storey shear (its
  inertia forces w² m u above the cut) is combined by the case's SRSS or CQC
  rule. A peak drift is not the difference of two peak displacements.
- **Modal** — the storey values of each mode shape, as OpenSees normalises it.
- **Pushover** — the last step's displacements and drifts.
