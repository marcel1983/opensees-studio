"""Staged construction: which elements and joints exist at each stage.

A :class:`~opensees_studio.core.analysis.StagedCase` lists stages that add and
remove groups of elements. This module turns that list into a plan the runner
follows and the case check reads:

* an element in a group some stage adds is **pending** until that stage; every
  other element exists from the start;
* an element in a group a stage removes leaves at that stage (it must exist by
  then, and it cannot come back);
* a joint is **active** while an active element touches it; a joint only pending
  elements touch is held still until they arrive.

No Qt, no OpenSees.
