"""Element force diagram data extraction.

Translates a :class:`StaticResults`'s raw 12-component local-force vectors
into per-element ``(value_at_i, value_at_j)`` pairs for a chosen force
component. The 3D beam local-force convention (matches OpenSees
``forceBeamColumn``/``elasticBeamColumn`` ``localForce`` response):

    index   component   description
    0       N1          axial force at node i (- = compression)
    1       Vy1         shear in local y at node i
    2       Vz1         shear in local z at node i
    3       T1          torsion at node i
    4       My1         moment about local y at node i
    5       Mz1         moment about local z at node i
    6       N2          axial force at node j
    7       Vy2         shear in local y at node j
    8       Vz2         shear in local z at node j
    9       T2          torsion at node j
    10      My2         moment about local y at node j
    11      Mz2         moment about local z at node j

For 2D models OpenSees returns only 6 components per element
([N1, Vy1, Mz1, N2, Vy2, Mz2]); we handle both shapes.

Diagram orientation: shear/moment values must be drawn perpendicular
to the element's local axis. The :class:`DiagramData` returned here
includes everything a renderer needs without re-querying OpenSees.

Between the ends a member under span loads is not linear. With
``stations=True`` the diagram also carries intermediate stations for every
frame member that has a span load (uniform, point, trapezoidal, self weight):
the internal forces follow from the end forces and the loads by statics, so
the moment diagram is parabolic under a uniform load and piecewise under point
loads. The values are those of ``values_i`` / ``values_j`` at the two ends.
