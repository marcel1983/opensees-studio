"""Solver engines: which program solves the model, and where it is installed.

The application does not ship a solver of its own. It models, and an *engine*
solves: today the only one is **OpenSeesPy**, a separate program with its own
license, which may or may not be installed next to the application. Without an
engine the application still models, exports and reports; only running an
analysis (and the two tools that call OpenSees directly, the stability check
and the Material Tester) needs one.

Where OpenSeesPy comes from is a user setting (:class:`SolverSettings`, kept in
``solver.json`` in the application data directory):

* the application's own Python environment (``pip install
  opensees-studio[opensees]``, or a bundle that includes it);
* another Python installation of the same minor version, whose ``openseespy``
  the user points at (:func:`inspect_python` asks that interpreter where it is);
* a folder that holds the ``openseespy`` package (what an in-app download will
  unpack into).

The folder of the last two is **appended** to ``sys.path`` of the process that
needs OpenSees (:func:`activate`) — the analysis child receives it in
:data:`ENGINE_PATH_ENV` — so the application's own libraries keep precedence and
only what it lacks is found there.

Engines beyond the built-in one register as ``opensees_studio.engines`` entry
points: an object with the :class:`SolverEngine` members. See
``docs/adr/ADR-0003-solver-engines.md`` for the contract.

Nothing here imports OpenSeesPy: detection uses ``importlib`` specs and package
metadata, so checking for a solver never loads its native library.
