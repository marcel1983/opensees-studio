# Tutorial 1 — Designing a steel moment frame (AISC 360-16)

**English** · [Español](01-steel-frame-design.es.md)

You will open a two-bay, two-storey steel frame, run its load cases, check every
member against AISC 360-16 and the storey drifts against ASCE 7, and see how the
lateral bracing of the beams decides whether the roof beams pass.

**You need:** OpenSees Studio with a solver (Options → Solver) and the example
`examples/steel_frame_design.osmodel` (or run `python examples/steel_frame_design.py`
to rebuild it).

## 1. The model

File → **Open…** → `examples/steel_frame_design.osmodel`.

It is a 2D frame in the X-Z plane: bays of 6 m, storeys of 4 m, fixed bases.

| Members | Section | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Columns | `W10X49` | from Define → Section Library |
| Beams | `W16X31` | braced at thirds of the span by the floor joists |

The sections were taken from **Define → Section Library** (AISC v16). They keep
the shape's name (`W10X49`), and that name is how the steel check knows which
shape to design with. A section you typed yourself can still be checked: name the
shape for its members in the check's overrides (step 4).

Loads, in **Define → Add Plain Load Pattern…** and the model tree:

- **DEAD**: self weight (the sections carry a unit weight of 77 kN/m³) plus
  25 kN/m on the beams.
- **LIVE**: 20 kN/m on the beams.
- **WIND**: 60 kN and 40 kN at the first and second floor.

and three combinations in **Define → Load Combinations…**: `1.4D`,
`1.2D+1.6L` and `1.2D+1.0W+L`.

## 2. Run the cases

**Analyze → Run All Cases**. Each static case runs once; the combinations are
evaluated from those results whenever they are needed, so they never run
themselves.

## 3. Check the members

**Design → Steel Frame Check (AISC 360-16)…**

![The steel frame check after Check](img/steel-check.png)

- **Method** LRFD, **Fy** 345 MPa (50 ksi), **ratio limit** 1.0. These were saved
  with the example; a new project starts from 50 ksi in its own units.
- The list on the right is what is enveloped: every **combination** is ticked by
  default. Tick a case to check it on its own. A case without a result says
  "no result: run it first".
- Press **Check**. One row per member, the largest ratio first: the governing
  check (here the **P-M interaction**, H1-1a or H1-1b), the equation and the load
  set that produced it.

The roof beams (elements 9 and 10) are at 0.97 and 0.94: the combination with
wind and the gravity combination respectively. They pass because their
compression flange is braced every 2 m, which the example stores as an override
(`Lb = 2 m`).

> **How the demands are read.** Each member is sampled at 25 stations, span
> loads included, and the largest axial force, moments and shears are taken
> together, which is conservative for the interaction. Cb comes from the
> member's own moment diagram (F1-1) unless you set it — set **Cb = 1.0 for a
> cantilever**.

## 4. What if the beams were not braced?

1. Close the dialog with **Cancel** and select the four beams (click them, or
   Select → By Section → W16X31).
2. Open the check again. The **Overrides for the 4 selected member(s)** box is
   now active.
3. Set **Lb (LTB) = 0** (the member length, 6 m) and press **Apply to the selected
   members**, then **Check**.

Lateral-torsional buckling over 6 m — beyond Lr, so the elastic F2-3 — now cuts
the beams' flexural strength: all four go to 1.2–1.4 and their rows turn red. **Select failing members** closes the dialog with them
selected, ready for Assign → Frame → Section… to give them a deeper shape. Press
**OK** to keep the overrides in the project, or **Cancel** to forget them.

The other overrides: the AISC **shape** to check with, **K** about each axis (the
buckling lengths are the member length times K), and **Cb**.

## 5. Check the storey drifts

**Design → Storey Drift Check…**

![The storey drift check with the ASCE 7 preset](img/drift-check.png)

- **Code** → *ASCE 7-22, Risk Category I/II (0.020 h)*.
- **Amplification** → 5.5, the Cd / Ie of a special steel moment frame: the
  analysis gives elastic drifts, ASCE 7 limits the amplified ones.
- **Check**: every static case with a result, storey by storey. WIND is the one
  that matters; the gravity cases sway almost nothing.

The storeys come from the Z grid lines (Define → Storeys…). A model without
storeys has nothing to check, and the dialog says so.

## 6. Save

**File → Save**. The design settings — method, Fy, the load sets, the member
overrides and the drift limit — are saved in the project. They do not change
any analysis result, so editing them never asks you to run again.

## What the check does not do

AISC 360-16 for **W, M, S and HP** shapes: tension yielding (rupture needs the
net area), compression (E3, E4, E7), flexure (F2, F3, F6), shear (G2.1, G6) and
H1. HSS, pipes, channels and angles are listed as not designed, and so is a
member whose section has no AISC name and no override. The numbers are checked
against the AISC Design Examples in the
[Verification Manual](../verification-manual.md) (cases D-01 to D-05).
