# Architecture

## Layering

OpenSees Studio uses a strict **MVVM + service layer** architecture. Dependencies
flow in **one direction only**: outer layers may depend on inner layers, never
the reverse.

### Why this matters

- The `core` package is testable without a display server, without OpenSees,
  and without Qt. CI runs `pytest tests/unit/` in milliseconds.
- Replacing OpenSeesPy with another solver (e.g. `xara`, a future fork) only
  touches `services/opensees_runner.py`.
- A future CLI or Jupyter frontend reuses `core` and `services` unchanged.

## Package map

| Package | Responsibility | Allowed imports |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | Domain entities and invariants | stdlib, numpy, pydantic |
| `services` | I/O, solver invocation, persistence | core + stdlib + h5py + openseespy |
| `viewmodels` | Bridge core ↔ Qt; expose Qt signals; manage undo/redo | core, services, PySide6 |
| `views` | Pure UI; no business logic | PySide6, pyvistaqt, viewmodels |
| `commands` | `QUndoCommand` subclasses; mutate model via services | services, viewmodels |

## Threading and the analysis process

The Qt main thread owns all widgets. OpenSees never runs in it:

- **Analyses** run in a child process. `viewmodels.AnalysisRunner` writes the
  pre-run snapshot and starts `python -u -m opensees_studio.run --project
  <snapshot> --cases <ids> --out <dir>` (the argv comes from
  `child_cli.analysis_cli_command()`, so frozen bundles re-enter themselves).
  The CLI prints one JSON object per line (`log`, `progress`, `case_started`,
  `case_finished`, `error`) and writes results through `services.result_store`
  (HDF5 + `manifest.json`); a hard exit inside OpenSees cannot take the window
  down, and Cancel kills the process.
- **Analyze → Check Model Stability** uses the same entry point with
  `--project <snapshot> --check-stability`: the child builds the model, reads
  the stiffness matrix (`services.stability`) and prints one `stability` line
  whose report `viewmodels.StabilityChecker` turns back into a
  `StabilityReport`.
- **Batch runs** (File → Run Batch…, `python -m opensees_studio.batch`) start
  the same CLI on each project file itself (no snapshot: the file is not open),
  with `--out <stem>_batch_results --record-db <stem>_results.sqlite`, so the
  child also fills the results database. `services.batch` plans the jobs and
  writes the summary and `batch.json` (the model fingerprint the results belong
  to); `viewmodels.BatchRunner` drives several `QProcess` children at a time,
  the CLI a thread pool of subprocesses. File → Open loads the stored results
  when the fingerprint still matches.
- `OPENSEES_STUDIO_IN_PROCESS=1` runs both on a thread / in process instead,
  for debugging. The Material Tester still calls OpenSees in the GUI process.

## Axes and the solver frame

Z is the elevation axis of every model. A 3D model uses X, Y and Z as they are;
a 2D model lives in the global **X-Z plane** (nodes at y = 0, DOFs Ux, Uz, Ry in
the node's storage slots 0, 2, 4). OpenSees' 2D models are in its own x-y
plane, so `core.plane` is the one mapping between the two: OpenSees receives
(X, Z) as its (x, y), and its in-plane rotation `rz` is a rotation about -Y, so
a 2D rotation or moment changes sign on the way (`dof_signs`). The runner emits
coordinates, hidden nodes, `-jntOffset` and `-orient` vectors, nodal loads and
displacement control through it, and applies the sign to every result it
reads, so result arrays keep OpenSees' DOF order with global signs. Files below
schema 3 store 2D models in the X-Y plane; `persistence.load_project` rotates
them +90° about X (`migrate_2d_payload_to_xz`).

## Persistence

- Project files: `*.osmodel` — a JSON document validated by Pydantic models.
  Human-readable, diff-able, version-controllable.
- Results: one HDF5 file per case plus `manifest.json` in the run's output
  directory (`services.result_store`, float64, lossless), rebuilt with
  `load_results`. Node results are in OpenSees' DOF order with global signs.
- Schema: `schema_version` 3 (2D models in the X-Z plane). A newer file is
  refused; older ones are migrated on load and saved as 3.

## OpenSeesPy command sequencing

`OpenSeesRunner` always emits commands in this order; the model layer enforces
that all required pieces exist before a run can be requested:

1. `wipe()` and `model('basic', '-ndm', ndm, '-ndf', ndf)`
2. `node(...)` for every node
3. `fix(...)` for every restrained DOF
4. `uniaxialMaterial(...)` / `nDMaterial(...)`
5. `section(...)` (if used)
6. `geomTransf(...)` for frame elements
7. `element(...)` for every element
8. `timeSeries(...)`
9. `pattern(...)` with nested `load(...)`
10. `recorder(...)`
11. `system / numberer / constraints / integrator / algorithm / analysis`
12. `analyze(...)`

Any deviation from this order is a runtime error in OpenSees. The runner
asserts the order at the service boundary; the UI never has to think about it.
